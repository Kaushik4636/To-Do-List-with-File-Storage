# To-Do List with File Storage in Python

Welcome to the **To-Do List with File Storage** project! This is a simple command-line application written in Python that helps you manage your to-do list. You can add tasks, mark them as complete, view them, and delete tasks as needed. The best part? Your tasks are saved to a file, so they persist even after you close the program.

## Features:

* **Add New Tasks**: Quickly add tasks to your to-do list.
* **View All Tasks**: See a list of all your tasks and their statuses.
* **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Mark tasks as complete with a simple command.
* **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
* **Persistence**: Your tasks are saved in a text file, ensuring that they’re available across program runs.

## Why This Project?

This project is a great way to practice core Python concepts, including:

* **File I/O**: Storing and retrieving tasks in a text file.
* **Lists/Dictionaries**: Storing tasks and their statuses.
* **User-defined functions**: Organizing code into reusable functions.
* **Loops and conditionals**: Navigating through a simple menu and modifying tasks.
* **Input validation**: Ensuring that users input valid data.

This project is simple, practical, and can be expanded as you learn more Python!
